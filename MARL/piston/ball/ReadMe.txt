PONG GAME

Overview

This project uses PyTorch, Pygame, and NumPy to simulate a learning-based paddle game.

Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Install all required packages by running: ```pip install torch pygame numpy```

How to Run
1. Launch the **PongGame** Python script.
2. The game window will open automatically.

Important Note

The paddles may move slowly on first launch due to initial model loading or optimization.
If the game feels sluggish:

1. Close the window.
2. Restart the program.
3. Performance should return to normal.
